This code should be everything required to run the project. The jar files should be included in the classpath for compilation and running, as this allows us to use JCuda and use GPUs.

This has been coded in eclipse, and the full eclipse project can be found on the github at https://github.com/JackMason12/Project-3D-Random-Walk-Segmentation-on-GPUs 

The src folder contains these source files. 

The images used for the results section of the report are included under the 'images' folder.

The CUDA toolkit v8 should be installed in order to use this software. The JCuda JARs included should be used in the classpath. Running Test will run the solution as it is currently, for 2D images. 

The "Matrix Framework" folder includes the matrix framework in java/jcuda mentioned in the report. It is not polished, and far from in working order, but demonstrates what we're talking about with the matrix framework.
